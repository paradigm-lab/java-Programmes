# Overview
Java is a statically-typed, object-oriented programming language. It's also a platform independent.


# Data Types
There are two broad categories of data types in java:

    * Primitive Types
        Are the basic types that store simple data and form the foundation of data manipulation. 
        For example, Integer Values(int, long, short), 
        Floating-point values (float and double),
        Character Values (char)
        Logical Values (boolean)

    * Object/Reference Types (Non-primitive types)
        Are objects that contain reference to values and/or other objects or 
        To the special value null to denote the absence of the value.

# Declaring Variables in Java
    To declare a variable in Java, We must specify its name (also called an idetifier) and type. 

    An identifier is a name of any length, consisting of letter, digits, underscore and dollar sign, That conform to the following rules:
        * Starts with a letter, an underscore(_) or a dollar sign($)
        * can't be a reserved keyword
        * can't be true, false (Boolean) or null

# Arrays 
    An array is a reference type that can store a collection of values of a specific type.
    General Syntax of declaring an array in java is:
        type[] identifier = new type[length];
        * The type can be any primitive or Object/Reference type
    To refer to a specific element of an array, or to assign a value to an element, we use the variable name and its index.
    In Java, array index start at zero. The first element of an array is at index 0, the second element is at index 1 and so on.
    Additionally we can get the length of an array by calling the lenght property, By using the identifier
