# Overview
Java is a statically-typed, object-oriented programming language. It's also a platform independent.


# Data Types
There are two broad categories of data types in java:

    * Primitive Types
        Are the basic types that store simple data and form the foundation of data manipulation. 
        For example, Integer Values(int, long, short), 
        Floating-point values (float and double),
        Character Values (char)
        Logical Values (boolean)

    * Object/Reference Types (Non-primitive types)
        Are objects that contain reference to values and/or other objects or 
        To the special value null to denote the absence of the value.

# Declaring Variables in Java
    To declare a variable in Java, We must specify its name (also called an idetifier) and type. 

    An identifier is a name of any length, consisting of letter, digits, underscore and dollar sign, That conform to the following rules:
        * Starts with a letter, an underscore(_) or a dollar sign($)
        * can't be a reserved keyword
        * can't be true, false (Boolean) or null
